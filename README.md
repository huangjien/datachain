# Data Chain

This project is trying to store data in a block chain.

## What kind of data can be stored in a data chain?
Non-private, non-time-sensitive or sharable data?
In some small company, some data supposed to be shared.

## Data in data chain cannot be changed, so how to do CRUD?
We can use CR to replace UD

## Update to latest
Consider using P2P

## POW
Of course, we don't want to waste on computing hash;
Consider calculating index, peers

## Performance

## Everything in a docker container
Because it is not private data; we don't need to use volume to keep data; Only consider 3rd party authentication.
